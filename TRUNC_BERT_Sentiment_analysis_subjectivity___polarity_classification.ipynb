One distinguishing characteristic of this model is the ability to learn information from both the left and right sides of a token's context. Applying this bidirectional training can give a deeper sense of language context. Unlike other models that use the same method, Bert makes use of Transformer, an attention mechanism that learns contextual relations between words in a text. A transformer embeds lists of tokens into vectors, and then they are processed inside the network.\n","\n","The base model used here is a 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameter neural network
